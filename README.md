# Dynamic Engine Sound for Space Engineers

Makes the engine sound pitch and volume change depending on load, making the engine "rev". This effect goes really well with hydrogen powered ground vehicles but can also serve as an indicator to quickly gauge the load on the power systems of ships and bases.

## Installation

Install the custom game launcher from the [Github repository](https://github.com/sepluginloader/SpaceEngineersLauncher). Instructions are at the bottom of the page. It will automatically install [Plugin Loader](https://github.com/sepluginloader/PluginLoader). Start the game using the launcher and open the Plugins window from the main menu. Click the little plus sign in the bottom right corner of the Plugins column and find this plugin in the list and enable it. The game must be restarted before it can be used.

## Support

I can be found in the KeenSWH and Plugin Loader Discord servers. Please provide the log file located in `%APPDATA%\SpaceEngineers\SpaceEngineers_xxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxx.log` as it often contains information crucial to solving your problem. If it looks more like a bug, please open an issue on the GitHub page or create a pull request if you can fix it on your own.
